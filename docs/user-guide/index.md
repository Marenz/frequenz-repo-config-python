# User Guide

This is a highly opinionated set of tools and configurations to set up a Python
repository for [Frequenz](https://frequenz.com) projects.

It offers:

* [Cookiecutter] templates for scaffolding new projects.
* Trivial build of `noxfile.py` with some predefined sessions that include all
  common checks.
* Tools to build protobuf/grpc files as Python, including type information.
