# Advanced usage

The [Cookiecutter] template uses some tools provided as a library by this
project.

Usually, users don't need to deal with it directly, but if your project needs
some extra customization (like disabling `nox` sessions or adding new ones, or
using different CLI options for some tools), then you'll need to.

You can find information about the extra features in the [API
reference](reference/frequenz/repo/config/).
